The User Management System allows you to manage users efficiently. First, you can add a new user to the system. Once added, the user will appear in a list that displays all users.

In this list, there is an Action column with three options: View, Edit, and Delete:

1. View: Clicking this opens a page displaying detailed information about the selected user.


2. Edit: Clicking this takes you to a page where you can see and update the user information through React CRUD API calls, showcasing CRUD operations in action.


3. Delete: This option allows you to remove the user from the system.



Additionally,With Axios an API link is provided below, which you can use to access the REST API. This API will display all user information in a JSON.
